# REST-API-Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a RESTful HTTP API. The goal of this project is to develop and test various API endpoints using web services, adhering to REST principles.

The project focuses on different aspects of API development and testing. The REST API is implemented and tested for messages, sensors, and Student Information System (STISYS) services. Tests are conducted for all implemented endpoints by sending requests from a client to the server using various methods such as GET, PUT, and POST. Different representations, like plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON, are also tested. The tool used to test the API is Postman.



This project provides hands-on experience in implementing and testing RESTful HTTP APIs. By completing this project, practical knowledge of API design, development, and testing is gained, which is essential for software engineering and web development.
